# StackChain Layer 2 Rollup

A high-performance Layer 2 rollup solution for the Stacks blockchain that enables scalable transactions with security guarantees.

## Features

- High-throughput transaction processing
- Secure state commitment system
- Challenge-response mechanism for dispute resolution
- User deposits and withdrawals
- Internal transfer capabilities
- Operator validation
- Merkle proof verification
- Balance tracking
- Comprehensive access controls

## Architecture

StackChain implements a Layer 2 rollup system with the following components:

- **Operator Management**: Trusted operators who submit state commitments
- **State Commitments**: Periodic submissions of Layer 2 state
- **Challenge System**: Mechanism to dispute invalid state transitions
- **Token Bridge**: Deposit and withdrawal functionality
- **Internal Transfers**: Efficient in-rollup token movements

## Security Features

- Operator validation and registration
- Challenge periods for dispute resolution
- Merkle proof verification for withdrawals
- Balance tracking and validation
- Comprehensive access controls
- Bond requirements for operators and challengers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain environment
- Clarity contract deployment tools
- STX tokens for testing

### Deployment

1. Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain
2. Register initial operator(s)
3. Configure challenge parameters
4. Begin accepting deposits

### Usage

```clarity
;; Register as an operator (contract owner only)
(contract-call? .stackchain register-operator)

;; Deposit tokens
(contract-call? .stackchain deposit u1000 u1)

;; Transfer within rollup
(contract-call? .stackchain transfer-in-rollup tx-sender 'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7 u100 u1)

;; Withdraw tokens
(contract-call? .stackchain withdraw u100 u1 0x...)
```
